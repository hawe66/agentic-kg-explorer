    abstract: >
      While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance
      across tasks in language understanding and interactive decision making, their
      abilities for reasoning and acting are studied separately. This paper explores
      the use of LLMs to generate both reasoning traces and task-specific actions in
      an interleaved manner, allowing for greater synergy between the two.

      discovering subgoals that decompose complex tasks into simpler subtasks.
