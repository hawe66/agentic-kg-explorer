- critic should recognize whether the retrieved data are insufficient to explain the query.
- human intents are too narrow.
- search planner is hard-coded. (Determine path direction based on entity type and intent type)
- 'INTENT_CLASSIFICATION_PROMPT', '_extract_entities' doesn't have info over graphdb's entities. Cannot exactly extract entities.
- cypher queries are too limited to search knowledge graph in a various way.
    - **IMPORTANT**: This project objective is to build a good knowledge graph to express agentic AI as a knowledge. It's not just making a chatbot.
- ABSOLUTELY NONSENSE. MUST CHANGE THING. 
    - `Base confidence on graph result count`: _calculate_confidence at src/agents/nodes/synthesizer.py
- nice if the md files introduced from this link [langchain docs](https://docs.langchain.com/llms.txt) are uploaded inside data/papers. Nicer if you make a script for crwaling this link. Much nicer if script is not this link specific but rather general
- streamlit ui are inconvenient
    - if i click example queries, it appears at chat ui but agent doesn't reply.
    - sometimes web reseult fonts are too big.
    - if i have to add to kg, I have to move all along upside. maybe better if a new block with highest z (upfront) would be more convenient.
    - add local docs upload ui (to data/papers)
- newly added docs entities in kg should be linked to principle/method/implementation.
